* 2021 Oct - **FSB**'s 10 recommendations for regulating stablecoin [report](https://github.com/uditgt/crypto/blob/main/FSB%20-%202021%20Oct%20Regulation%2C%20Supervision%20and%20Oversight%20of%20%E2%80%9CGlobal%20Stablecoin%E2%80%9D%20Arrangements.pdf)
* 2021 Nov - **OCC** Clarifies [pdf](https://github.com/uditgt/crypto/blob/main/OCC%20-%202021%20Nov%20-%20clarification.pdf), [link](https://www.occ.gov/news-issuances/news-releases/2021/nr-occ-2021-121.html)
* 2021 Nov - **President's Working Group Report** (Treasury, FED, SEC, CFTC, +OCC, +FDIC) [report](https://github.com/uditgt/crypto/blob/main/PWG%20-%20report.pdf), [memo](https://github.com/uditgt/crypto/blob/main/PWG%20-%20memo.pdf)
  * $97 trillion of non-cash payments (2018) through debit card, credit, ACH, check
  * Risk - SBCs face "credit risk, liquidity risk, operational risk, risk from poor governance, and settlement risk" + risk from custodial wallets
    * Credit risk - loss of confidence during stress period
    * Liquidity risk - SBC operates 24/7, but payment system to swap  SBC and Fiat operates regular business hours
    * Operational risk - network congestion due to lack of incentive, disagrement on updates
    * Settlement risk - some networks may not clearly define point of technical/ legal completion
  * Legislative Suggestions - 
    * require SBIs to be 'insured depository institutions'
    * subject custodial wallet providers to Federal oversight
    * limit role of custodial wallet providers (e.g. cannot issue coins, make loans) - *to avoid concentration of power* / *agency problem*
    * establish standard for inter-operability between stablecoins
* 2022 Jan - **FRB** Money & Payments [report](https://github.com/uditgt/crypto/blob/main/FRB%20-%202022%20Jan%20-%20Money-and-payments.pdf)
  * Strengthens USD as global reserve currency - *maybe foreign individuals will hold USD reserve in future too*
  * Risk to Banking - outlow of Deposits + higher cost of borrowing - can be mitigated by placing limit on indiviual holding of CBDC; paying 0% interest
* 2022 Feb - **FRB** Project Hamilton [Phase-1](https://github.com/uditgt/crypto/blob/main/Project-Hamilton-Phase-1-Whitepaper.pdf) 
* 2022 Feb - **FSB** Assessment of Risks to Financial Stability from Crypto-assets [report](https://github.com/uditgt/crypto/blob/main/FSB%20-%202022%20Feb%20Risks%20to%20Financial%20Stability%20from%20Crypto%20Assets.pdf). Intermediation between TradeFi and Crypto is increasing - banks/ institutions getting increasing involved + use of complex/leverage products. **Key Risks:**
  1. **Crypto-assets** (not backed by reserves, e.g. BTC) - increasing mainstreet exposure (ETFs, CME futures, Treasury investments), intermediation with general economy - 'wealth' effect, 'confidence' effects, increasing acceptance of crypto-payment rails (El Salvador, Tesla)
  2. **Stablecoins** - liquidity mismatch, credit risk; run on reserves can spill to short-term funding markets; redemption rights differ. **GSCs (GLobal Stable Coins)** also exposed to currency risk (issuance â‰  assets), risk of disintermediation to domestic banks if people switch to foreign more stable currency
  3. **DeFi** - special risks, e.g. no clear legal liablity; concentration to few protocols and technologies

**Speeches**
* 2021 Nov - SEC **Caroline Crenshaw** [pdf](https://github.com/uditgt/crypto/blob/main/SEC%20-%202021%20Nov%20Caroline%20Crenshaw.pdf), [link](https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/crenshaw-defi-20211109)
* 2022 Jan - OCC **Michael Hsu** [pdf](https://github.com/uditgt/crypto/blob/main/OCC%20-%202022%20Jan%20-%20Michael%20Hsu%20speech.pdf), [link](https://www.occ.gov/news-issuances/news-releases/2022/nr-occ-2022-2.html)
* 2022 Feb - FRB **Lael Brainard** [pdf](https://github.com/uditgt/crypto/blob/main/FRB%20-%202022%20Feb%20-%20Lael%20Brainard%20speech.pdf), [link](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/files/brainard20220218a.pdf), [stablecoin paper](https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/ifdp/files/ifdp1334.pdf)
  *  (Brainard) Key risks - points to 'run risk' and 'systemic risk'. (Michael) Trust is important. If people trust they can redeem stablecoins there will be no need to actually redeem stablecoins for fiat.
  *  Growing popularity - Pew Research 16% people personally traded crypto, up from 1%. 37% of underbanked indicate they own cryto-currency vs. 10% for fully banked.
  *  (Michael) Regulating SBIs as Banks would give credibility to "stable" part of stablecoins, and help drive innovation by allowing firms to focus on "Level 2"
  *  Lack of access to digital banking and payment services for some segments and expensiveness of cross-border payments
  *  Fed is thinking **crititcally** about CBDC - *need it to play out lender of last resort role* - esp. in times of crises when people move from stablecoins to fiat...  Complementary role of private stablecoin and CBDC
  * **4 key principles for CBDC - (i) privacy, (ii) intermediated through bank, (iii) widely transferable, and (iv) identity-verified**

**ex-USA CBDCs**
* CBDC [tracker](https://cbdctracker.org/)
* **e-CNY**: Phased roll-out from 2019. 261mn users by 2021-end, accepted by 8+mn merchants [link1](https://www.scmp.com/tech/tech-trends/article/3163953/chinas-digital-currency-e-cny-wallet-nearly-doubles-user-base-two). PBOC [whitepaper](https://github.com/uditgt/crypto/blob/main/POBC%20-%20eCNY%20whitepaper%202021%20July.pdf), 2021 July.

### Crypto Ecosystem: DeFi / dApps, Exchanges (CEX / DEX), Corporates, Oracles, Auditors, Blockchains 
* **Compound** - DeFi lending/ borrowing protocol. [whitepaper_v1.0](https://github.com/uditgt/crypto/blob/main/Compound.Whitepaper.pdf), [link](https://compound.finance/docs#guides), [Adam Bavosa](https://medium.com/compound-finance/a-walkthrough-of-contributing-to-the-compound-protocol-9450cbe2133a), [article1](https://linen.app/articles/how-to-use-compound-liquidity-pools-to-earn-your-first-defi-yield/)
* **Compound Treasury** - Launched in June 2021. convert USD to USDC and supply to Compound to earn 4% return (Fireblock as custody) [deck](https://github.com/uditgt/crypto/blob/main/Compound%20Treasury%20Overview.pdf), [risk assessment](https://github.com/uditgt/crypto/blob/main/CompoundMarketRiskAssessment.pdf). Structured as a security at front-end. Participates in the same permissionless pool, and not a segregated pool. 
* **AAVE**: Similar to compound, but borrowing/ lending rate are more [stable](https://docs.aave.com/risk/liquidity-risk/borrow-interest-rate) + Allows [Flash Loans (9bps)](https://docs.aave.com/faq/flash-loans). [docs](https://docs.aave.com/developers/getting-started/v3-overview), [v3whitepaper](https://github.com/aave/aave-v3-core/blob/master/techpaper/Aave_V3_Technical_Paper.pdf)
* **AAVE Arc**: Announced ~July 2021 and launched [~Jan 2022](https://cryptobriefing.com/aave-has-launched-permissioned-pools-for-institutions/), it is a permissioned liquidity pool designed to be compliant with AML. Provide segregated liquidity pool, where you engage with only known participants [fireblock](https://www.fireblocks.com/blog/permissioned-defi-goes-live-with-aave-arc-fireblocks/). **Allows** institutional clients to participate in DeFi lending/ borrowing to earn yields. [Fireblocks](https://www.fireblocks.com/platforms/permissioned-defi/) carries out KYC for institutional clients. [article](https://www.techdreams.org/crypto-currency/aave-arc-a-gateway-for-tradefi-enter-the-defi-world/10570-20210901)
* **Ripple's XRP** is in a lawsuit with SEC, since SEC claims it is a ['security'](https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/22/22196064/ripple-sec-cryptocurrency-security-currency-xrp) and not a 'currency'. [CBDC report](https://github.com/uditgt/crypto/blob/main/Ripple%20CBDC%202020.pdf), [Trends report](https://github.com/uditgt/crypto/blob/main/Ripple%20Crypto%20Trends%202022.pdf)
  * Unlike Bitcoin and Ethereum which are mined and deemed currencies, *"Ripple started XRP by creating 100 billion units all at once. Ripple owns about 6.4 billion XRP, and Garlinghouse and Larsen also own a good chunk of it. Another 48 billion XRP are held in reserve, for periodic sales. This difference may be why the SEC is claiming XRP is a security, not a currency."*
* **Uniswap** v3 allows LPs to concentrate liquidity in a price range (vs. (0, inf)) [whitepaoer_v3](https://github.com/uditgt/crypto/blob/main/Uniswap%20-%20whitepaper-v3.pdf), [tutorial](https://help.uniswap.org/en/articles/5391541-provide-liquidity-on-uniswap-v3)
* **dYdX** - offers margin trading on derivatives; no KYC, no custody; after initial on-chain approval trades are on **StarkEx**; not available in [USA](https://dydx.exchange/terms) due to tighter regulatory restrictions [article](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffkauflin/2021/10/15/how-a-19-person-cryptocurrency-exchange-surpassed-coinbase-in-daily-trading-volume/?sh=21f8cf023066)
* **Coinbase** rewards can be due to 'interest' (e.g. [USDC](https://help.coinbase.com/en/coinbase/taxes-reports-and-financial-services/financial-services/usd-coin-rewards-faq), [DAI](https://help.coinbase.com/en/coinbase/trading-and-funding/other/dai-rewards)), ['inflation'](https://help.coinbase.com/en/coinbase/trading-and-funding/staking-rewards/staking-inflation) or ['staking'](https://help.coinbase.com/en/coinbase/trading-and-funding/staking-rewards/yield). Sweeping funds to Compound supply pool is considered a [security](https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/8/22662826/coinbase-sec-lend-regulation-crypto-lawsuit-exchange) by SEC so Coinbase haulted its [Lend](https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/9/22826888/coinbase-defi-interest-non-us-compound-lending-program#) program. [medium post](https://blog.coinbase.com/the-sec-has-told-us-it-wants-to-sue-us-over-lend-we-have-no-idea-why-a3a1b6507009)
* **BlockFi**  having similar issues with [SEC](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2022-26)
Works off *proof-of-stake* [consensus](https://docs.avax.network/), [whitepaper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.08936.pdf)
* **Public Companies** holding BTC as [treasury asset](https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/treasuries/) - MicroStrategy (125k), Tesla (43k), Square (8k)
* **DeFi as a Service**: [VaporNodes](https://vapornodes.finance/) - [investments](https://docs.vapornodes.finance/project-information/treasury-investments); [MidasDAO](https://midasdao.org/) - $290k of initial funding; [Tosdis](https://tosdis.finance/), [AvantGarde/Enzyme](https://avantgarde.finance/)
* **Auditors**: [Hacken](https://hacken.io/)

**StableCoins**
* Tether / USDT - [attestation report](https://tether.to/en/transparency/#reports), [Dec-21](https://assets.ctfassets.net/vyse88cgwfbl/4hiNJsZ98LlZqCJHKzrLpV/2b6338482ef0093382885f80ba6f1083/Tether_Assurance-12-31-21.pdf)
* Centre / USDC - Coinbase + Circle; Launched on Ethereum (+[Avalance](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/127439/circles-usdc-stablecoin-deployed-on-avalanche-blockchain)), extended to Solana, Stellar, Algorand, TRON etc. [attestation report](https://www.centre.io/usdc-transparency)
* Binance USD - BUSD
* DAI

**Blockchain Trilemna**: decentralization, security, and scalability
* [Layer-1](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/blockchain-layer-2-network-layer-1-network#section-layer-1-scaling-solutions): Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin; improve scalability through increasing data/block, consensus protocol (PoW -> PoS), sharding
* [Layer-2](https://academy.binance.com/en/glossary/layer-2): abstract majority of data processing to auxiliary architecture (e.g., nested blockchains, sidechains, plasma) mainchain comes for dispute resolution. E.g., [Polygon](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/polygon-crypto-matic-network-dapps-erc20-token) uses its own PoS blockchain and Commit Chain connectivity to help scale the Ethereum network. Similarly, [Bitcoin Lightning Network](https://lightning.network/) for Bitcoin, [pdf](https://lightning.network/lightning-network-summary.pdf). Other solutions derive security from Layer-1 (rollsups: optimistic, zk; state channels). [videos](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/scaling/)
  * [Optimistic rollup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pWxCklcNsU) relies on 'fraud-proof', and post data to L1 assuming it is correct. Party submitting has a bond (ETH deposit), and so does party providing proof. If correct no additional work! If incorrect another party can submit 'fraud-proof' -> enter dispute resolution -> tx is tried again, this time on L1 -> if it fails deposit is slashed (penalty). (-) Submitter has to provide enough time to others to submit 'fraud-proof' -> withdrawal times can be long. (+) EVM compatible, 99% of contract can be ported easily. (e.g., Optimism, Arbitrum, OMG, Cartesi)
  * ZK rollup relies on cryptography. Every batch posted on L1 includes zk-snark, which can be directly confirmed by L1. (-) Much harder to develop EVM-compatible zk-rollup. (-) more computational heavy. (e.g., Loopring, Kermes, zkTube, Aztec, Starkware)
* Cardano, Solana, Cosmos are also [L-1 blockchains](https://inc4.net/the-layer-1-blockchain-boom-how-cardano-solana-and-cosmos-are-challenging-ethereum/). Cardano created by Ethereum co-founder. Cosmos focuses on interoperability b/w chain; Inter-Blockchain Communication standard (IBC), allowing for token and data transfers across blockchains.
* [**Polkadot**](https://polkadot.network/blog/what-is-polkadot-a-brief-introduction/) (~Layer-0) - is a sharded multi-chain network. Enables forkless upgrades, allowing blockchains to evolve and adapt easily as better technology becomes available. [post1](https://polkadot.network/blog/the-parachain-advantage-exploring-polkadots-next-generation-model/), [post2](https://polkadot.network/blog/what-is-polkadot-part-2-the-vision/)
* **Avalanche** - also considered [Layer-0](https://research.thetie.io/avalanche-ecosystem/) because it has three blockchains on it (X-xchange, P-latform, C-ontract). Built primarily for dApps. C-chain is an instance of Ethereum powered by Avalanche. Uses PoS (Snowman consensus). [doc](https://docs.avax.network/learn/platform-overview/#contract-chain-c-chain)
* **Concerns** with all these scaling solutions: fragmented liquidity, some may dominate others, may lead to complete dis-intermediation from main-chains.
* Ethereum [rollup roadmap](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/a-rollup-centric-ethereum-roadmap/4698)
