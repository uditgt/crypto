  * $97 trillion of non-cash payments (2018) through debit card, credit, ACH, check
  * Risk - SBCs face "credit risk, liquidity risk, operational risk, risk from poor governance, and settlement risk" + risk from custodial wallets
    * Credit risk - loss of confidence during stress period
    * Liquidity risk - SBC operates 24/7, but payment system to swap  SBC and Fiat operates regular business hours
    * Operational risk - network congestion due to lack of incentive, disagrement on updates
    * Settlement risk - some networks may not clearly define point of technical/ legal completion
  * Legislative Suggestions - 
    * require SBIs to be 'insured depository institutions'
    * subject custodial wallet providers to Federal oversight
    * limit role of custodial wallet providers (e.g. cannot issue coins, make loans) - *to avoid concentration of power* / *agency problem*
    * establish standard for inter-operability between stablecoins

**Speeches**
* 2022 Jan - OCC Michael Hsu [pdf](https://github.com/uditgt/crypto/blob/main/OCC%20-%202022%20Jan%20-%20Michael%20Hsu%20speech.pdf), [link](https://www.occ.gov/news-issuances/news-releases/2022/nr-occ-2022-2.html)
* 2022 Feb - FRB Lael Brainard [pdf](https://github.com/uditgt/crypto/blob/main/FRB%20-%202022%20Feb%20-%20Lael%20Brainard%20speech.pdf), [link](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/files/brainard20220218a.pdf), [stablecoin paper](https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/ifdp/files/ifdp1334.pdf)
  *  (Brainard) Key risks - points to 'run risk' and 'systemic risk'. (Michael) Trust is important. If people trust they can redeem stablecoins there will be no need to actually redeem stablecoins for fiat.
  *  Growing popularity - Pew Research 16% people personally traded crypto, up from 1%. 37% of underbanked indicate they own cryto-currency vs. 10% for fully banked.
  *  (Michael) Regulating SBIs as Banks would give credibility to "stable" part of stablecoins, and help drive innovation by allowing firms to focus on "Level 2"
  *  Lack of access to digital banking and payment services for some segments and expensiveness of cross-border payments
  *  Fed is thinking **crititcally** about CBDC - *need it to play out lender of last resort role* - esp. in times of crises when people move from stablecoins to fiat...  Complementary role of private stablecoin and CBDC
  * **4 key principles for CBDC - (i) privacy, (ii) intermediated through bank, (iii) widely transferable, and (iv) identity-verified**

### Industry Stuff
* **Compound** - DeFi lending/ borrowing protocol. [whitepaper](https://github.com/uditgt/crypto/blob/main/Compound.Whitepaper.pdf), [link](https://compound.finance/docs#guides), [Adam Bavosa](https://medium.com/compound-finance/a-walkthrough-of-contributing-to-the-compound-protocol-9450cbe2133a), [article1](https://linen.app/articles/how-to-use-compound-liquidity-pools-to-earn-your-first-defi-yield/)
* **Coinbase** rewards can be due to 'interest' (e.g. [USDC](https://help.coinbase.com/en/coinbase/taxes-reports-and-financial-services/financial-services/usd-coin-rewards-faq), [DAI](https://help.coinbase.com/en/coinbase/trading-and-funding/other/dai-rewards)), ['inflation'](https://help.coinbase.com/en/coinbase/trading-and-funding/staking-rewards/staking-inflation) or ['staking'](https://help.coinbase.com/en/coinbase/trading-and-funding/staking-rewards/yield). Sweeping funds to Compound supply pool is considered a [security](https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/8/22662826/coinbase-sec-lend-regulation-crypto-lawsuit-exchange) by SEC so Coinbase haulted its [Lend](https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/9/22826888/coinbase-defi-interest-non-us-compound-lending-program#) program. [medium post](https://blog.coinbase.com/the-sec-has-told-us-it-wants-to-sue-us-over-lend-we-have-no-idea-why-a3a1b6507009)
* **Ripple's XRP** is in a lawsuit with SEC, since SEC claims it is a ['security'](https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/22/22196064/ripple-sec-cryptocurrency-security-currency-xrp) and not a 'currency'. [CBDC report](https://github.com/uditgt/crypto/blob/main/Ripple%20CBDC%202020.pdf), [Trends report](https://github.com/uditgt/crypto/blob/main/Ripple%20Crypto%20Trends%202022.pdf)
  * Unlike Bitcoin and Ethereum which are mined and deemed currencies, *"Ripple started XRP by creating 100 billion units all at once. Ripple owns about 6.4 billion XRP, and Garlinghouse and Larsen also own a good chunk of it. Another 48 billion XRP are held in reserve, for periodic sales. This difference may be why the SEC is claiming XRP is a security, not a currency."*
