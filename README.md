  * $97 trillion of non-cash payments (2018) through debit card, credit, ACH, check
  * Risk - SBCs face "credit risk, liquidity risk, operational risk, risk from poor governance, and settlement risk" + risk from custodial wallets
    * Credit risk - loss of confidence during stress period
    * Liquidity risk - SBC operates 24/7, but payment system to swap  SBC and Fiat operates regular business hours
    * Operational risk - network congestion due to lack of incentive, disagrement on updates
    * Settlement risk - some networks may not clearly define point of technical/ legal completion
  * Legislative Suggestions - 
    * require SBIs to be 'insured depository institutions'
    * subject custodial wallet providers to Federal oversight
    * limit role of custodial wallet providers (e.g. cannot issue coins, make loans) - *to avoid concentration of power* / *agency problem*
    * establish standard for inter-operability between stablecoins

### Speeches
* 2022 Jan - OCC Michael Hsu [pdf](https://github.com/uditgt/crypto/blob/main/OCC%20-%202022%20Jan%20-%20Michael%20Hsu%20speech.pdf), [link](https://www.occ.gov/news-issuances/news-releases/2022/nr-occ-2022-2.html)
* 2022 Feb - FRB Lael Brainard [pdf](https://github.com/uditgt/crypto/blob/main/FRB%20-%202022%20Feb%20-%20Lael%20Brainard%20speech.pdf), [link](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/files/brainard20220218a.pdf), [stablecoin paper](https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/ifdp/files/ifdp1334.pdf)
  *  (Brainard) Key risks - points to 'run risk' and 'systemic risk'. (Michael) Trust is important. If people trust they can redeem stablecoins there will be no need to actually redeem stablecoins for fiat.
  *  Growing popularity - Pew Research 16% people personally traded crypto, up from 1%. 37% of underbanked indicate they own cryto-currency vs. 10% for fully banked.
  *  (Michael) Regulating SBIs as Banks would give credibility to "stable" part of stablecoins, and help drive innovation by allowing firms to focus on "Level 2"
  *  Lack of access to digital banking and payment services for some segments and expensiveness of cross-border payments
  *  Fed is thinking **crititcally** about CBDC - *need it to play out lender of last resort role* - esp. in times of crises when people move from stablecoins to fiat...  Complementary role of private stablecoin and CBDC
  * **4 key principles for CBDC - (i) privacy, (ii) intermediated through bank, (iii) widely transferable, and (iv) identity-verified**
